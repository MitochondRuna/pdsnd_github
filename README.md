### Date created
This project was created In July 2020 with the first version completed on
July 7 2020.

### Project Title
Udacity project: US bikeshare data

(aka _Runa's first ever program!_)

### Project Background
This program was created as a project submission requirement for the Udacity
"Programming for Data Science in Python" course.
This submission required the generation of an interactive program using the US bikeshare data provided in three separate csv files.

To complete this task, I used the new skills I had learnt through the course, including example exercises and practice questions.
For some parts of the project I needed some extra assistance and turned to google for help. Any related code I have incorporated into my program has been documented below under "Credits".
This is pretty much my first ever _program_ so I welcome feedback so I may improve in future.
